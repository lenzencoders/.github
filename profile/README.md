LENZ Encoders are non-contact bearingless absolute angle encoders. Two printed circuit board design is perfect to match wide variety of control and
measurements applications with limited space. Precise position data up to 22 bits and reliable fast
feedback in harsh environments. \

LENZ encoders are inductive position sensors based on the physical principles of electromagnetic
induction. Our encoders combine easy installation, low integration cost, high accuracy, stability over
time, are extremely robust. \

LENZ encoders are insensitive to electromagnetic fields, permanent magnets, power lines, parasitic
capacitance, metallic parts and electrical noises.
